Latent Dirichlet Allocation Quiz

1) (True/False) According to the assumptions of LDA, each document in the corpus contains words about a single topic.

True
False V

2) (True/False) Using LDA to analyze a set of documents is an example of a supervised learning task.

True
False V

3) (True/False) When training an LDA model, changing the ordering of words in a document does not affect the overall joint probability.

True V
False

4) (True/False) Suppose in a trained LDA model two documents have no topics in common (i.e., one document has 0 weight on any topic with non-zero weight in the other document). As a result, a single word in the vocabulary cannot have high probability of occurring in both documents.

True
False V

5) (True/False) Topic models are guaranteed to produce weights on words that are coherent and easily interpretable by humans.

True
False V (It's NOT guaranteed but if well implemented is true most of the time)
