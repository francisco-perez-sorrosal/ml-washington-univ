1) (True/False) While the EM algorithm maintains uncertainty about the cluster assignment for each observation via soft assignments, the model assumes that every observation comes from only one cluster.

True V
False

2) (True/False) In high dimensions, the EM algorithm runs the risk of setting cluster variances to zero.

True V
False

5) Which of the following correctly describes the differences between EM for mixtures of Gaussians and k-means? Choose all that apply.

k-means often gets stuck in a local minimum, while EM tends not to
EM is better at capturing clusters of different sizes and orientations V
EM is better at capturing clusters with overlaps V
EM is less prone to overfitting than k-means
k-means is equivalent to running EM with infinitesimally small diagonal covariances. V

6) Suppose we are running the EM algorithm. After an E-step, we obtain the following responsibility matrix:

Cluster responsibilities	Cluster A	Cluster B	Cluster C
Data point 1	0.20	0.40	0.40
Data point 2	0.50	0.10	0.40
Data point 3	0.70	0.20	0.10

Which is the least probable cluster for data point 1?

Cluster A V
Cluster B
Cluster C

7) Suppose we are running the EM algorithm. After an E-step, we obtain the following responsibility matrix:

Cluster responsibilities	Cluster A	Cluster B	Cluster C
Data point 1	0.20	0.40	0.40
Data point 2	0.50	0.10	0.40
Data point 3	0.70	0.20	0.10

Suppose also that the data points are as follows:

Dataset	X	Y	Z
Data point 1	3	1	2
Data point 2	0	0	3
Data point 3	1	3	7

Let us compute the new mean for Cluster A. What is the Z coordinate of the new mean? Round your answer to 3 decimal places.


Soft Count Cluster A = 0.2+0.5+0.7 = 1.4
Soft Count Cluster B = 0.4+0.1+0.2 = 0.7
Soft Count Cluster C = 0.4+0.4+0.1 = 0.9
----------------------------------------
                               sum = 3.0

Soft counts A, divided by the sum = 1.4/3.0 = 0.46 (Not needed)

[Weighted sum of data points for cluster A]
= [Fraction of data point 0 represented in cluster A] * [data point 0]
  + [Fraction of data point 1 represented in cluster A] * [data point 1]
  + [Fraction of data point 2 represented in cluster A] * [data point 2]
= 0.2*[data point 0] + 0.5*[data point 1] + 0.7*[data point 2]
= 0.2 * (3,1,2) + 0.5 * (0,0,3)  + 0.7 * (1,3,7)
= (0.6,0.2,0.4) + (0,0,1.5) + (0.7, 2.1, 4.9)
= (1.3,2.3,6.8)

Mean of cluster A:

= (x,y,4.857)

8) Which of the following contour plots describes a Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance? Choose all that apply.
