# Quiz 1

1) (True/False) k-means always converges to a local optimum.
True V
False

2) (True/False) The clustering objective is non-increasing throughout a run of k-means.
True V
False

3) (True/False) Running k-means with a larger value of k always enables a lower possible final objective value than running k-means with smaller k.
True V
False

4) (True/False) Any initialization of the centroids in k-means is just as good as any other.
True
False V

5) (True/False) Initializing centroids using k-means++ guarantees convergence to a global optimum.
True
False V

6) (True/False) Initializing centroids using k-means++ costs more than random initialization in the beginning, but can pay off eventually by speeding up convergence.
True V
False

7) (True/False) Using k-means++ can only influence the number of iterations to convergence, not the quality of the final assignments (i.e., objective value at convergence).
True
False V

8) Consider the following dataset:
                  X1     X2
Data point 1    -1.88   2.05
Data point 2    -0.71   0.42
Data point 3     2.41  -0.67
Data point 4     1.85  -3.80
Data point 5    -3.69  -1.33
Perform k-means with k=2 until the cluster assignment does not change between successive iterations. Use the following initialization for the centroids:

             X1      X2
Cluster 1   2.00    2.00
Cluster 2  -2.00   -2.00
Which of the five data points changed its cluster assignment most often during the k-means run?

9) Suppose we initialize k-means with the following centroids


Which of the following best describes the cluster assignment in the first iteration of k-means?
The first picture
